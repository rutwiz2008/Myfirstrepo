I am writing a content related to a Topic: Steps in Problem Solving

Problem solving involves using logical steps to reach a solution.  
The first step is defining the problem clearly and completely.  
Next, an algorithm is created to describe the procedure.  
After that, the logic is implemented in a programming language.  
The program is then tested with sample inputs and outputs.  
Errors found must be debugged to achieve correct results.  
Finally, the solution should be evaluated for efficiency.  
Effective problem solving helps improve coding and logical skills.  
This process forms the base for developing AI and ML applications.  
By practicing regularly, students develop strong computational thinking.
